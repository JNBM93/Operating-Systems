Starting and shutting down computers and mobile devices is an important function of an operating systems (OS). They allow to quickly narrow the troubleshooting process by identifying any major hardware issues. The kernel process looks at any hardware connections to verify if they are working correctly. If not, the OS will display an error message, beep, or prevent further starting of the computer or mobile device.
Managing RAM memory is another important function of an OS. It allows the OS to point out any program or application that is using RAM. IF enough RAM is being used the computer will appear to be sluggish or even potentially freeze. A potential remedy to the slow performance would be to use virtual memory which is the process of using a portion of a storage medium (a hard drive, USB, etc.) to function as additional RAM.
Monitoriing performance is a function that is vital to the OS. It assesses and reports on information about the many computer resources and devices.The performance monitor allows for a quick look at what is potential slowing the computer down by looking at processes and how much RAM is being used up. It also displays information on WiFi, CPU, and network usage.
